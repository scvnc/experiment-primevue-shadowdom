# experiment-primevue-shadowdom

[Deployed Demo](https://scvnc.github.io/experiment-primevue-shadowdom/)

I am experimenting with having PrimeVue used in a ShadowDOM environment for microfrontends.  Not all components seem to work in this scheme.



## Scaffolding

This was scaffolded with `yarn create vue` [docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html)
